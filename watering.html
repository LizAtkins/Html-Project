  <h1>Do's and Don'ts of Watering Plants</h1>

<h2>1. Do hydrate plants in the morning</h2>
<p>The most efficient time to water outdoor flowers and vegetables is before the heat of the day when the soil is cool and the water has the best chance of seeping down to the roots of the plants before evaporating. Watering plants early will ensure that they have sufficient store of moisture beneath the soil to withstand the heat of a hot summer day.</p>
<h2>2. Don't water too frequently or too little.</h2>
<p>Especially during hot weather, it may be tempting to water just enough—and often enough—to keep the soil damp. Shallow surface watering, however, discourages deep root development. Instead, opt for a less frequent watering routine that thoroughly saturates the soil. This method encourages the roots to reach deeply for residual water, even when the surface of the soil appears dry. The standard rule of thumb is to give your flowers and vegetables the equivalent of at 1 inch of water per week (and as much as double that amount in the peak of summer).</p>

<h2>3. Do water plants at soil level.</h2>
<p>Directing water at the base of your plants delivers the hydration right where it's needed: the roots. Consider winding a soaker hose between plants in a flower or vegetable bed to soak the soil slowly and deeply and ensure healthy growth.</p>
<h2>4. Don't water houseplants with treated softened water.</h2>
<p>Home water softeners impart sodium into your tap water, which, over time, can negatively affect the mineral makeup of a houseplant's soil. Depending on your plumbing, your water softener may connect only to the hot water faucets or to all the faucets in your home, both hot and cold. If it's the latter (or you aren't sure), stick to filling your watering can at an outdoor spigot to minimize the amount of sodium you introduce to the soil.</p>
<h2>5. Do water less in winter and more in spring.</h2>
<p>During the winter, the days are shorter and indoor houseplants receive less ambient light through windows. As a result, photosynthesis (the process in which a plant turns light into food) slows and the plant enters a resting phase, during which it needs less water. As spring approaches, however, longer days signal the plant to start growing, and at this time, its water needs increase. Adjust your habits for watering plants accordingly so as not to cause distress or thirst. <br><br><br></p>

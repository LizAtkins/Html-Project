    <h2>These are the first plants grown in moon dirt</h2>
    <h3>The small garden shows the promise and potential challenges of farming on the moon</h3>
   

<p>That's one small stem for a plant, one giant leap for plant science.<br><br>
In a tiny, lab-grown garden, the first seeds ever sown in lunar dirt have sprouted. This small crop, planted in samples returned by Apollo missions, offers hope that astronauts could someday grow their own food on the moon.<br><br>
But plants potted in lunar dirt grew more slowly and were scrawnier than others grown in volcanic material from Earth, researchers report May 12 in Communications Biology. That finding suggests that farming on the moon would take a lot more than a green thumb.

  <h2>Earth may have 9,200 more tree species than previously thought</h2>
  <h3>More than a third are probably hiding out in South America, researchers say</h3>
  <p>Trillions of trees are growing on Earth, though how many kinds there are has been underestimated, a new study finds.<br><br>
    Earth hosts roughly 64,100 known tree species. But there could be at least 73,300 — about 14 percent more than previously thought — a global collaboration of researchers reports in the Feb. 8 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.<br><br>
    More than a third of the 9,200 undiscovered species are probably rare and hiding out in South America's biodiversity hot spots, such as the Amazon and tropical Andes, biologist Roberto Cazzolla Gatti of the University of Bologna in Italy and colleagues say.</p>

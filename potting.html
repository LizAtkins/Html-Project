    <h3>Late winter/early spring is a great time to repot houseplants since they're getting ready to begin their spring growth spurt, and we gardeners are so stir crazy that we're looking for a good reason to get our hands dirty! Depending on your plant's needs, you have several options:</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Repot in a Bigger Pot: For plants that are actively growing and have become pot bound.</li>
        <li>Repot in the Same Pot with Fresh Soil: For neglected plants or ones you wish to keep the same size.</li>
        <li>Refresh the Top Layer of Soil: For very large plants that would be hard to repot, or healthy ones that you'd like to spruce up.</li>
      </ul></p>

        <h3>When to Repot Plants</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Plants that are straggly, pale, or have stopped growing.</li>
        <li>Water runs immediately out the bottom without soaking into the soil.</li>
        <li>Top heavy plants that keep falling over. </li>
        <li>Pots without drainage holes in the bottom. </li>
        <li>Roots that poke out of the soil or the holes in the bottom of the pot.</li>
    </ul></p>

            <h3 id="header">4 Types of Soil For Your Garden</h3>
            <ol>
            <li><h4>Loamy soil</h4></li>
            <p>Three main components make up soil: sand, silt, and clay. Loamy soil includes all three in equal amounts. That means that it drains well, retains a lot of moisture, and breathes enough for air to reach the roots of a plant.</p>
            <li><h4>Sandy soil</h4></li>
            <p>The gritty texture of sandy soil makes it naturally dry and crumbly. It's typically not highly nutritious; its nutrients can be easily washed away during wet periods. But as long as it's supplemented with organic fertilizer or similar additives, sandy soil makes a great bed.</p>
            <li><h4>Silty soil</h4></li>
            <p>The high silt concentration of this soil allows it to retain large amounts of moisture and nutrients. That makes it a fantastic choice for gardening, provided your garden drains adequately. </p>
            <li><h4>Peaty soil</h4></li>
            <p>The peat makes this soil acidic and less nutritional. To grow healthy plants in peaty soil, mix in nutrient-rich organic matter, plus additives like lime to lower the acidity.</p>

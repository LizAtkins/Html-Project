                  <h1>Best House Plants For Beginners</h1>
                  <p> Here are some of the best house plants for those new to the world of greenery. These plants are some of the easiest to take care of with little to no experience. All of these images were created using <a href="https://midjourney.com">Midjourney.</a></p>

                  <h3>1. The Succulent</h3>
                  <p> This plant is great for beginners. Succulents are a very diverse group of plants that hold a timeless appeal for any gardener, no matter how green their thumb may be. With a nearly infinite number of varieties, succulent growing can keep even the most avid grower and collector interested. And with their low-maintenance needs and readiness to propagate, they're easy to care for and forgiving of first-time gardeners still getting the hang of things.</p>

                  <h3>2. The Pothos </h3>
                  <p>This plant isn't just easy to care for (it is so indestructible that it has earned the nickname “Devil's Ivy” because of its hardiness). Even in the worst cases of neglect, the plant will communicate its thirst by heavily drooping, only to spring back to life once it's watered. Though the Pothos grows best in bright light, it can survive even in dark corners of a home or office, so even if you aren't sure what light your space has, you can bet this plant will be just fine!</p>
                  <div id="wrap"><img class="left" src="images/aloe.png" alt="image"></div>
                  <h3>3. The Aloe</h3>
                  <p>Aloe vera (also known as medicinal aloe) is a popular plant that is best known for the healing qualities of the gel. For best results, place it in a sunny, south-facing window. The good news is that aloes go dormant during the winter months, so they don't require as much care as they do during the spring and summer. Aloe vera plants are super easy to grow, and there's really not much to it. Yours might just do better if you ignore it, they thrive on neglect. Don't over water this one!</p>
                  <div id="wrap"><img class="right" src="images/snake.png" alt="image"></div>
                  <h3>4. The Snake</h3>
                  <p>These plants are easy to grow and, in many cases, are nearly indestructible. They will thrive in very bright light or almost dark corners of the house. Snake plants generally grow slowly in indoor light, but increasing its exposure to light will boost growth if it receives a few hours of direct sun.</p>
